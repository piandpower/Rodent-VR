	Initializes module for reading movement input.
	This component reads movement input by measuring the changes in position measured by
	two optical computer mice placed 90 degrees from each other on the equator of a 
	ball. The mice should be placed such that the Y axis of the device points upward.
	Mouse B should be placed directly behind the rodent, and Mouse A should be placed on the side.

	The component works by reading the Y axis deltas of the two optical mice simultaneously.
	Mouse A's Y delta represents movement in X, while Mouse B's Y delta represents movement in Y.

	The method takes as input a map of configuration parameters. The confiuration parameters that
	are accepted by this module are: "mouse_a_name" and "mouse_b_name".
	The names of the computer mice can be found on Windows by:
	Opening Windows' Device Manager > Selecting a device > Details > Device instance path.
